						stupid? well all computers do is read and interpret the 
						<br>documents/code it is given if a programmer makes even a small <br>

					  See a human would be able to see that mistake and quickly <br>
					  and logicly fix it.

						documents in. Just like a college student would use <br>
					word or pages to create the paper programmers use <br>

					write code. For instance when creating tags some <br>
					editors will automatically generate a closing tag <br> 
					for you.
